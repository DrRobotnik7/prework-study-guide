        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <br />
        <p class = "HTML">This website is a great HTML resource <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">MDN HTML</a></p>
        <p class = "HTML">For the purposes of this section, brackets are to be replaced with angled brackets in VS Code</p>
        <p class = "HTML">The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</p>
        <p class = "HTML">Try to use semantic elements as much as possible. They do what they say i.e. header and img, which makes your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>The code starts with the (!DOCTYPE html) declaration, which tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>The (html) opening tag represents the root, or start, of our HTML document. Inside the (html) tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage</li>
          <li>The (head) element contains metadata, data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users such as such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>
          <li>The (header) element can contain a navigation menu and/or introductory content</li>
          <li>The (body) element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The (h1), (h2), (h3), (h4), (h5), and (h6) elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Each page should only contain maximum one (h1) heading</li>
          <li>The (main) element contains the main part of the website vs the body element which contains everything visible on the page</li>
          <li>The (p) element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The (img) element is self-closing e.g. (img src="https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/prework/module-03/lesson-01/cute-pandas-02.jpg" alt="Cute Pandas" width="520" height="346")</li>
          <li>The (ul), (ol), and (li) elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The break element (br /) introduces a page break and looks like (br /)</li>
          <li>The anchor element (a) creates hyperlinks to a webpage e.g. (a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/giant-panda")More About Giant Pandas(/a)</li>

        <h3>Adding external CSS style sheet to asset file</h3>
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>cd "insert repo name here" then cd assets: moving to the assets folder, obviously repo must have that folder first</li>
          <li>touch style.css: adds file to asset file</li>
          <li>git status: make sure you are in the main branch, if not then navigate there with git checkout main</li>
          <li>git checkout -b feature/add-css: adds a new branch to work on</li>
          <li>In VSCode navigate to new style.css file in assets folder</li>
          <li>Copy and paste whatever rules you want in your style sheet</li>
          <li>The * selector applies to ALL elements on the page</li>
          <li>Where possible use multiple selectors in one rule instead of having same rule multiple times - see DRY rule (do not repeat yourself). This reduces the number of lines of code.</li>
          <li>Add the following in the head section, after the meta elements (link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css")</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <h3>Useful information</h3>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>This website is a great CSS resource <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">MDN CSS</a></li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Use class selectors to apply rules to all members of a class e.g. (p class="footer") in HTML then a .footer selector in style.css sheet</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Common commands</h3>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>git clone "paste copied SSH value here": clone repository to local environment</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: sync so local main branch mirrors latest version of GitHub main branch - otherwise you might be working on outdated code</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds modifications made to the staging area, so these will be pushed up on next commit</li>
          <li>git commit -m "insert description of what you are adding here"</li>
          <li>git push origin "enter name of branch you are working on here": moves changes to the cloud, it will now appear in GitHub</li>
          <li>git checkout "enter name of branch here": moves to the branch you want to work on</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>GitHub Workflow</h3>
        <br />
        <h4>First, make repo on GitHub website. Now, set up local environment:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>git clone "paste copied SSH value"</li>
          <li>git status</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: make a new branch</li>
          <li>git status: check you are working in the new branch</li>
          <li>git pull origin main</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <h4>Now make changes to your new branch:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>git add -A</li>
          <li>git commit -m "insert description of what you are adding here"</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: again, sync the local main with the cloud main branch</li>
          <li>git push origin "enter name of branch you are working on here": moves changes to the cloud, it will now appear in GitHub</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <h4>Now do a pull request at GitHub to merge your changes from the new branch into the main branch in the cloud:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Once merged delete the branch you were working on as it has now merged into the main branch</li>
          <li>Finally we need to sync our local environment back with the cloud so need to pull down the main branch. Go to the command prompt:</li>
          <li>git checkout main - moves to the main branch</li>
          <li>git pull origin main - syncs local copy with the updated branch on GitHub</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Adding external JS sheet to asset file</h3>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Create script.js in assets file, same process as adding CSS file</li>
          <li>In index.html, at the bottom under (footer) but above (body) add code (script src="./assets/script.js")(/script)</li>
          <li>It goes at the bottom as it affects the HTML code, the browser reads code from top to bottom. So for JS to affect the HTML code, HTML needs to load first</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>Useful information</h3>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics">MDN JS Basics</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures">MDN JS Data Structures</a></li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>String i.e. letters need to be in quotation marks. Numbers and Boolean true/false values don't need to be.</li>
          <li>In JS and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. The first item has an index of 0, not 1. The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>As per the above, the below code will result in triangle because it has an index of 0. Square is 1, pentagon is 2 etc.
            <br />var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];
            <br />console.log(shapes[0]);</li>
