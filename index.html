        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>For the purposes of this section, brackets are to be replaced with angled brackets in VS Code</p>
        <p>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</p>
        <p>Try to use semantic elements as much as possible. They do what they say i.e. header and img, which makes your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The code starts with the (!DOCTYPE html) declaration, which tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>The (html) opening tag represents the root, or start, of our HTML document. Inside the (html) tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage</li>
          <li>The (head) element contains metadata, data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users such as such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>
          <li>The (header) element can contain a navigation menu and/or introductory content</li>
          <li>The (body) element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The (h1), (h2), (h3), (h4), (h5), and (h6) elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Each page should only contain maximum one (h1) heading</li>
          <li>The (main) element contains the main part of the website vs the body element which contains everything visible on the page</li>
          <li>The (p) element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The (img) element is self-closing e.g. (img src="https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/prework/module-03/lesson-01/cute-pandas-02.jpg" alt="Cute Pandas" width="520" height="346")</li>
          <li>The (ul), (ol), and (li) elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The break element (br /) introduces a page break and looks like (br /)</li>
          <li>The anchor element (a) creates hyperlinks to a webpage e.g. (a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/giant-panda")More About Giant Pandas(/a)</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <h3>Common commands</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git clone "paste copied SSH value here": clone repository to local environment</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: sync so local main branch mirrors latest version of GitHub main branch - otherwise you might be working on outdated code</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds modifications made to the staging area, so these will be pushed up on next commit</li>
          <li>git commit -m "insert description of what you are adding here"</li>
          <li>git push origin "enter name of branch you are working on here": moves changes to the cloud, it will now appear in GitHub</li>
          <li>git checkout "enter name of branch here": moves to the branch you want to work on</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>GitHub Workflow</h3>
        <h4>First, make repo on GitHub website. Now, set up local environment:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Now set up local environment</li>
          <li>git clone "paste copied SSH value"</li>
          <li>git status</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: make a new branch</li>
          <li>git status: check you are working in the new branch</li>
          <li>git pull origin main</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Now make changes to your new branch:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>git add -A</li>
          <li>git commit -m "insert description of what you are adding here"</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: again, sync the local main with the cloud main branch</li>
          <li>git push origin "enter name of branch you are working on here": moves changes to the cloud, it will now appear in GitHub</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Now do a pull request at GitHub to merge your changes from the new branch into the main branch in the cloud:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Once merged delete the branch you were working on as it has now merged into the main branch</li>
          <li>Finally we need to sync our local environment back with the cloud so need to pull down the main branch. Go to the command prompt:</li>
          <li>git checkout main - moves to the main branch</li>
          <li>git pull origin main - syncs local copy with the updated branch on GitHub</li>
        </ol>
